# Prototypical Web Application using Next.js

This web app template is based on React and Next.js for hybrid static & server rendering.
Click [here](https://prototypical-web-app.vercel.app/) to see it running on Vercel.

It is configured with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for type safety and code consistency.

It uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for unit testing.

It uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to run eslint/prettier/jest as a pre-commit hook.

It is configured with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the CSS framework.

**WARNING: This app uses the Next.js [/app directory](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) that is currently in beta.**

## Get started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` and go to `http://locahost:3000` to run the dev server locally

## Running tests

You can run all tests with `npm run test`, or you can just use jest directly using `npx jest`.

Run a specific test with `npm run test [filePath]`.

## Running the linter

You can run the linter with `npm run lint`.

It is recommended to set up a linter plugin in your IDE/editor, so you can see all lint errors while writing code and auto-format your code on save.

## Building the app

You can use `npm run build` to build a production version of the app.
